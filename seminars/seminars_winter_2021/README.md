# Potential changes for next time (29 March 2021)

* Reorder some of the later seminars
  * in particular, a better order for 8, 9, 10, 11 might be 11, 10, 9, 8 (but also depends on whether changes are made to lecture schedule) 
* Move no seminar week later - perhaps coinciding with week progress reports or Analysis Assignment are due
* Add deliverable component to some of the later seminars
