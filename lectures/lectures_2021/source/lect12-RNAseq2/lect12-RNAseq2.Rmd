# Learning objectives (lectures 11 and 12)

<big>

* Understand *why* and *when* between and within sample normalization are needed

* Apply common between and within sample normalization approaches to RNA-seq counts

* Understand why the *count nature* of RNA-seq data requires modification to the Differential Expression approaches applied to microarray data (e.g. limma)

* Apply models such as limma-trend, limma-voom, DESeq2 and edgeR for inference of Differential Expression

# One option: Voom

<big>

### Mean-variance modelling at the observational level

* Falls under the category *"Make adjustments and model as usual"*

* Specifically, adjustment to regular `lm` to take into account the M-V relationship

* **Key idea**: modeling the mean-variance relationship is more important than getting the probability distribution exactly right (i.e. don't bother with other distributions like Poisson, Binomial, etc)

--

* Input:
  * **raw counts** (required to estimate M-V relationship), but modeling is done on log-transformed CPM values (log2(CPM + 0.5), to be precise)
  * design matrix

* Implemented in [`limma` package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html): `voom` function

---

# Voom steps

<big>

1. Fit linear model to $log2(CPM_{ij} + 0.5)$ values (samples $i$, genes $j$)

2. Extract the fitted quarter-root error variances $\sqrt{\hat{sd}(\epsilon_{ij})}$

3. Fit a smoothed line $\hat{f}$ to the trend between mean log count and $\sqrt{\hat{sd}(\epsilon_{ij})}$ using [lowess](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/smoothing.html#local-weighted-regression-loess) (locally weighted regression)

--

4. Use the fitted lowess curve to estimate *observational weights*: $w_i = \frac{1}{\hat{f}(\hat{c}_{ij})^4}$ <br> where $\hat{c}_i$ are the log2 fitted *counts* (estimated from model in step 1)

5. Fit linear model to $log2(CPM_{ij} + 0.5)$ values **using observational weights** $w_{ij}$

6. Compute moderated $t$-statistics as before (using `eBayes`)

* locally weighted regression fits a smooth curve to approximate the relationship between independent and dependent variables

* Each smoothed value is given by a weighted linear least squares regression over the **span** (a neighborhood of the independent variable)

* Smoothing span is adjustable

# Why quarter-root variance?

* The squared **coefficient of variation** $(CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu})$ for RNA-seq counts is roughly $CV^2 =\frac{1}{\lambda} + \phi$
  * $\lambda$ is expected size of count
  * $\phi$ is a measure of biological variation (*overdispersion*)
  
* First term arises from technical variability associated with sequencing, and gradually decreases with increasing expected count size 

* Second term remains roughly constant

--

#### CV of RNA-seq counts should be a decreasing function of count size for small to moderate counts, and asymptote to a value that depends on biological variability ([Law et. al, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4053721/#B34))

--

* Standard deviation of log2(CPM) is approximately equal to CV of the counts (by Taylor's theorem) 

$$sd(log_2(CPM)) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1}{\lambda} + \phi}$$
--

* Square root of standard deviation used as distribution is more symmetric

---

# Weighted least squares (WLS) regression

<big>

* OLS: $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty}$

* WLS: $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta} = (X^TWX)^{-1}X^TWy}$, where $W$ is a diagonal matrix of weights

* **Intuition**: in minimizing the sum of squared errors, we put less weight on data points that are less precise: 

$$\hat{\beta}_{j} = argmin_{\beta_j} \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n w_{ij}(X_i^T \beta_j - y_{ij})^2 \Big)$$
--

* Optimal weights for this purpose: inverse variance

* Remedies heteroskedasticity 

* Note: parameter estimates $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ assume weights (variances) are known

---

# limma-voom

<big>

* limma-voom is the application of limma to log2(CPM + 0.5) values, with inverse variance observational weights estimated from the M-V trend

* This alleviates the problem of heteroskedasticity and (hopefully) improves estimates of residual standard error

* Gene-specific variance estimates are 'shrunken' to borrow information across all genes:

$$\tilde{s}^2_g = \frac{d_0s_0^2 + ds^2_g}{d_0 + d}$$ 

--

* Note that $s^2_g$ estimates are affected by voom weights
  
  * recall that $s^2_g$ is the sum of squared residuals $\frac{1}{n-p}\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_g}^T\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_g}$
  * under WLS $\boldsymbol{\hat{\epsilon_g} = y - X\hat{\beta} = y- X(X^TWX)^{-1}X^TWy}$
  
---

# limma-voom, continued

<big>

* Moderated $t$ statistics are then calculated using the shrunken gene-specific variance estimates: $\tilde{t}_{gj} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{gj}}{\tilde{s}_g \sqrt{v_{jj}}}$

  * recall that under OLS, $v_{jj}$ is the $j^{th}$ diagonal element of $(X^TX)^{-1}$
  * under WLS, $v_{jj}$ is the $j^{th}$ diagonal element of $(X^TWX)^{-1}$

* Degrees of freedom for moderated $t$ statistic: $n-p+d_0$ 

* If prior degrees of freedom $(d_0$, estimated from data) is large compared to $n-p$, moderated statistics have a bigger effect compared to using regular $t$ statistics
  * i.e. in general, shrinkage matters more for small sample sizes

---

# Differential expression analysis on Chd8 data

<big>

* Recall: We'd like to fit am **additive** model for each gene so we can test for Group (Chd8 mutant vs WT) effect, and adjust for:
  * Sex (M vs F)
  * DPC (days post conception, 5 levels)

$$Y_{i} = \theta + \tau_{Mut} x_{i,Mut} + \tau_{F} x_{i,F} + \tau_{D14.5} x_{i,D14.5} + \tau_{D17.5} x_{i,D17.5} + \tau_{D21} x_{i,D21} + \tau_{D77} x_{i,D77} + \epsilon_i$$
<small>
$$x_{i,Mut} = \bigg\{\begin{array}{l} 
1\text{ if sample } i \text{ is Mutant} \\
0 \text{ otherwise}\\
\end{array}, \hspace{1em} x_{i,F} = \bigg\{\begin{array}{l} 
1\text{ if sample } i \text{ is Female} \\
0 \text{ otherwise}\\
\end{array}, \hspace{1em}x_{i,D\#} = \bigg\{\begin{array}{l} 
1\text{ if sample } i \text{ is DPC#} \\
0 \text{ otherwise}\\
\end{array}$$

where $D\# \in \{D14.5, D17.5, D21, D77\}$
<big>

* Our model has $n-p=44-7=37$ degrees of freedom

* We will focus on the null hypothesis of the **main effect** of Group $H_0: \tau_{Mut}=0$

# Another option: limma-trend

#### Limma-trend uses the M-V relationship at the **gene** level, whereas voom uses **observational** level trends ([Law et. al, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4053721/#B34))

<big> 

* Gene-wise variances are shrunken toward a global M-V trend, instead of toward a constant pooled variance:

$$\tilde{s}^2_g = \frac{d_0s_{0g}^2 + ds^2_g}{d_0 + d}$$ 
--

* Notice the $g$ subscript on $s_{0g}^2$! The prior variance is different for each gene (unlike in regular limma)

* Based on the M-V trend, $s_{0g}^2$ is (typically) higher for lowly expressed genes

# Nuances for limma-trend and limma-voom

<big>

* If M-V relationship is flat, limma-voom and limma-trend have practically no effect

  * for limma-voom, weights will be all equal
  
  * for limma-trend, $s_{0g}^2$ will be constant across genes

* Even if it's not flat, the impact is seen most prominently in lowly expressed genes

---

# limma-voom 'false positives'?

* This is one of the top genes for differential expression by Group by voom (but not other methods)

* Why does this happen? 
  * For voom the weighting means that very low expression values are going to have little effect on the model fit
  * Inspecting the weights for this gene they are about 30-40x higher for DPC 77 observations
  
* Whether this is a false positive is a matter of opinion, but lesson is: *always look at the data*

  * **Generalized linear models** (GLM) are a generalization of OLS that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution
  
* Still fit models gene-by-gene as we've discussed so far

* Many similarities with limma: empirical Bayes-based moderation of parameters and addressing the M-V trend
]

---

# Why Negative Binomial distribution?

* Negative Binomial is also known as a Poisson-Gamma mixture

  * i.e. A Poisson with a rate parameter that is Gamma-distributed (instead of fixed)
  
  * The Gamma distribution on means captures the biological variance (overdispersion) that can't be accommodated by Poisson alone

* "Overdispersed Poisson" (variance > mean)

* Key problem: estimating dispersion from small datasets is tricky

```{r, fig.width = 24, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width = 400}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/overdisp.png"))
```

---

# Negative Binomial GLM

<big>
$$\sigma_g^2 = \mu_g(1+\mu_g\phi_g)$$
where $\phi_g$ is the dispersion for gene $g$ (if $\phi_g=0$, get Poisson)

* We can perform inference about $\mu_g$ using GLM (e.g. using likelihood ratio tests)

--

* To do so, we need to treat $\phi_g$ as known (so first need to estimate it)

--

### Estimation of dispersion is the main issue addressed by methods like `edgeR` and `DEseq2`

---

# Disperson estimation

* One option is to assume $\phi$ is a set parametric function of the mean $\mu$ (e.g. quadratic)

* More flexible approach is to use empirical Bayes techniques:

  * Dispersion is gene-specific but moderated toward the observed trend with the mean

---

# DESeq2 vs edgeR

* These methods are very similar overall 

* Major differences between the methods lie in how they filter low-count genes, estimate prior degrees of freedom, deal with outliers in dispersion estimation, and moderate dispersion of genes with high within-group variance or low counts
  * Also slight differences in types of hypothesis tests (quasi-likelihood in edgeR and Wald test in DESeq2)

* Many of these choices can be altered by changing default parameter settings in both methods (see user manuals)

# How to choose a method?

<big>

* No established gold standards

  * Simulations somewhat unsatisfying (depend on specific settings)
  
  * In real data, the truth is unknown
  
--
  
* The most popular and widely used methods tend to give similar results

* **edgeR** and **DESeq2** are very similar in design
  
  * might be expected to work better for small sample sizes or low read depth
    
* **limma-trend** or **limma-voom** also sound choices

  * work equally well when library sizes don't vary much
  
  * might not do as well when sample size or depth is very low
  
---

# Comparing methods on the Chd8 dataset

#### tl;dr version: there isn't a big huge difference

<big>

Possible reasons why:
* methods have been converging in approach
* modeling count data directly with GLMs is more important for smaller samples sizes, lower read depth
