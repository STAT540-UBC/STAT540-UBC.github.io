## Course communication

In the web-oriented setting, it is vital that we have a dedicated plan for how we will communicate throughout the semester.

**General questions**: We encourage you to use the [course Github Discussion repository](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Discussion) (you will be granted access after we collect your Github user IDs) for posting questions, so that the message can be seen by the entire teaching team, and so that others in the class who might have the same question can learn from responses. You are also welcome to share your input on questions posted by others. Course announcements will also be posted in this repository, so please check it regularly (and/or subscribe to notifications).

**Private matters**: For private matters, please contact the Teaching team by email (listed above).

**Group work**: In your final project teams, we encourage you to make use of (1) the discussion feature in your GitHub Teams group, and (2) the issues feature in your group's project repo. In addition, you are encouraged to meet regularly via a platform of your choice (e.g. Microsoft Teams). Please reach out if you have any questions or challenges in this space.

## Prerequisites and Resources

This interdisciplinary course requires a broad range of skills at the interface of statistics, molecular biology / genomics, and computing. While you may have some background in one or more of the following areas, you are not expected to be an expert in all. That said, to be successful in the course, you may need to spend a bit more time in the areas that you have less experience in. Although there are no official prerequisites for the course, here is a list of useful skills to bring into the course and/or learn along the way.

**Statistics**: 

- You should have already taken a university level introductory statistics course. 
- [This free online book "Modern Statistics for Modern Biology" by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber](http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/) is a great reference for introduction or review of many of the statistical concepts that are relevant for this course.
- [This free online book "Data Analysis for the Life Sciences" by Rafael Irizarry and Michael Love](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/) is another great resource for introduction or review of many of the statistical concepts relevant in this course, with an emphasis on implementation in R.

**Biology**: 

- No requirements, but you are expected to learn things like, e.g. the difference between DNA and RNA, and the difference between a gene and a genome.
- See [Seminar-0c](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/STAT540-UBC.github.io/raw/master/seminars/seminars_legacy/sm01e_biology-intro-2017.pdf) for some basic introductory material.
- [This free online book "Concepts of Biology" by Fowler, Roush & Wise](https://openstax.org/books/concepts-biology/pages/1-introduction) is a great resource for biological concepts, in particular chapters 6 and 9
- [This free online book "Biology" by Clark, Douglas & Choi](https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/1-introduction) goes more in-depth, see Chapters 14, 15, and 16 for material on genetics that is particularly relevant for this course.
- No matter your prior experience, when you come across a new biological concept during the course or in your research, you might need to spend a bit of time 'learning as you go' - this is expected and something I still do regularly in my day-to-day research!

**R**: 

- No experience required but be prepared to do a lot of self-guided learning if you haven't taken other courses on R or used it in your research.
- Start now by installing [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and the HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "integrated development environment" (IDE) [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - both are free and open source. 
- You should be able to run R on your own computer during each seminar session.
- If you are new to R, check out [this blog post on getting started with R](http://santina.me/Get-started-with-R/).
- [This free online book "Introduction to Data Science" by Rafael Irizarry](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/) is also a great resource for getting more in-depth with R, programming basics, and the tidyverse. In particular see Chapters 1-5:
  - [Chapter 1: Getting Started with R and R Studio](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/getting-started.html)
  - [Chapter 2: R Basics](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html)
  - [Chapter 3: Programming Basics](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/programming-basics.html)
  - [Chapter 4: The tidyverse](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/tidyverse.html)
  - [Chapter 5: Importing data](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/importing-data.html)
  
**Other computing tools:** 

- In this course we'll be using the version control software [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and its web-based hosting and collaborative platform [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub). 
- [The online resource "Happy Git and GitHub for the useR" from Jenny Bryan](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a great reference for these tools as we learn them.
- Another helpful git resource is [Hadley Wickham's webinar "Collaboration and time travel- version control with git, github and RStudio"](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/collaboration-and-time-travel-version-control-with-git-github-and-rstudio/)
- We'll learn about using [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to generate readable and reproducible reports with code and text, and you'll be using that a lot in this course - see [Chapter 18 of the 'Happy Git' resource: "Test drive R markdown"](https://happygitwithr.com/rmd-test-drive.html).

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(timevis))

assignment_data <- read.csv("../course-admin/assn_2021.csv",as.is = T,sep = ",")
assignment_data$start <- paste0(assignment_data$start, " 23:59:00")
timevis(assignment_data, options= list(verticalScroll=TRUE, zoomable = FALSE),
        height=375)
```

### [Intro Assignment (5%)](assignments.html#intro-assignment-5)

- An introductory assignment designed to assess basic knowledge of GitHub, R and Rmarkdown

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
assn <- read.csv("../course-admin/assn_2021.csv")
assn <- assn %>% 
  select(content,start,Category) %>%
  rename(Assignment = content, `Due Date` = start) %>%
  mutate(`Due Date` = as.Date(`Due Date`, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  arrange(`Due Date`) %>% 
  mutate(`Due Date` = format(`Due Date`, "%a %d %B %Y"))

## Academic Integrity

Not only is academic integrity is essential to the successful functioning of our course, but adopting best practices will benefit you in your research practice. Make sure you understand UBC’s definitions of academic misconduct and its consequences. Policy guidelines can be found [here](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,958).

What does academic integrity look like in this course? 

* **Do your own work**. All individual work that you submit should be completed by you and submitted by you. Do not receive or share completed coursework with students who take the course in another term.

* **Acknowledge others’ ideas**. Scholars build on the work of others, and give credit accordingly. This refers to both outside sources, such as from the literature, and inside sources, such as from your peers.

* **Learn to avoid unintentional plagiarism.** Visit the [Learning Commons’ guide to academic integrity](http://learningcommons.ubc.ca/resource-guides/avoiding-plagiarism/) to help you organize your writing as well as understand how to prevent unintentional plagiarism. 

At any time: if you are unsure if a certain type of assistance is authorized, please ask.  

## Video Etiquette & Privacy

During synchronous lecture and class sessions, please observe the following guidelines to help foster a productive learning environment:

* Please note that synchronous sessions and their recordings will not be made available to anyone outside the course
* If your environment is suitable and you are comfortable doing so, please turn your cameras on
* Please keep your microphone muted when you aren't speaking to minimize background noise 
* Please make use of the chat feature to ask questions or make comments - the TAs will be monitoring this space
